# Gesture-Control
# Description
---
This project is a wearable glove device designed to enable communication through finger gestures. Equipped with five flex sensors—one on each finger—the glove detects various bending positions of the fingers. Each unique combination of finger bends (5! total combinations) is mapped to a specific pre-set message. Once a gesture is detected, we can use either the display attached to the auduino to display it or attaced the speaker to play the message.
