# Description

This project is a wearable glove device designed to enable communication through finger gestures. Equipped with five flex sensors—one on each finger—the glove detects various bending positions of the fingers. Each unique combination of finger bends (5! total combinations) is mapped to a specific pre-set message. Once a gesture is detected, we can either use the display attached to the Arduino to show the message or connect a speaker to play the message as audio.
How It Works:

# Complete Setup



Equipment Used:

1. Arduino
2. Flex Sensors
3. Breadboard
4. 16x2 Display
5. Potentiometer
6. Resistance
7. Wires

# How It Works:

1. The user wears a glove with flex sensors attached to each finger.
2. As the user bends their fingers, the flex sensors measure the changes in resistance.
3. When resistance reaches a threshold value (to be determined during testing), we identify the bending pattern and its corresponding message.
